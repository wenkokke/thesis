# Hypersequent Calculus {#hcp-and-hypersequent-calculus}

The hypersequents used in HCLL are similar to those used by @Avron91:hypersequents.
Both are stratified extensions to the structure of the logic.
However, their interpretations are rather different.
HCLL's hypersequents are linear, multiplicative, and conjunctive, whereas @Avron91:hypersequents's hypersequents are unrestricted and "usually disjunctive" [@Avron96:hypersequents, p. 4].
