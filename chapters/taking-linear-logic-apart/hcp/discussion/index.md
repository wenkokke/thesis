# Discussion {#hcp-discussion}

This section proceeds as follows:

- In @hcp-zap-exceptionally-absurd-offer,
  I introduce an alternative semantics for the absurd offer based on exception handling.
- In @hcp-sync-link,
  I introduce synchronous semantics for link.
- In @hcp-variant-types-and-guarded-summation,
  I introduce a variant of HCP that decomposes the binary and $n$-ary offer into the singleton offer and summation, which allows us to type guarded summation and enables us to factor actions out into their own syntactic category.
- In @hcp-channel-names-vs-endpoint-names,
  I discuss channel names and endpoint names.
- In @hcp-do-tensor-and-par-correspond-to-send-and-receive,
  I discuss the relation between tensor and par and send and receive.
- In @hcp-and-deep-inference,
  I discuss the relation between HCP and deep inference logic.
- In @hcp-and-hypersequent-calculus,
  I discuss the relation between HCP and hypersequent calculus.
- In @hcp-and-mix,
  I discuss the relation between the empty hypersequent and hypersequent composition in HCP and the \Rule{CLL-Mix0} and \Rule{CLL-Mix} rules.
