# Deep Inference and Display Calculus {#hcp-and-deep-inference}

Hypersequents add *stratified* structural connectives.
HCLL's hyper-environments may contain environments, but its environments may not contain hyper-environments.
(In a sense, HCLL's structures are restricted to conjunctive normal form.)
As such, we can view HCLL as a stratified variant of the formulations of CLL as deep inference calculi [e.g., Flat BV, @Guglielmi07:sis, p. 51; or LS, @Strassburger02:ls] or display calculi [e.g., @Belnap89:ll-displayed], where every logical connective has a corresponding structural connective without any such stratification.
