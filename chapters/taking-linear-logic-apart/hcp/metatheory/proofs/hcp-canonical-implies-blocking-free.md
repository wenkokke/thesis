Proof.
  ~ As $\canonical(\hpP)$, $\hpP\hpEvalA/$ and $\hpP\hpEvalB/$.
    By @proposition:hcp-beta-free-iff-blocked-on-free, there exists some $\hptm{A}\subseteq\fn(\hpP)$ such that $\blocked(\hpP,\hptm{A})$.
    By definition, $\hptm{A}\subseteq\blocking(\hpP)$.
    It remains to show that $\blocking(\hpP)\subseteq\hptm{A}$.

    By contradiction.

    Assume $\hpx\in\blocking(\hpP)$ and $\hpx\notin\hptm{A}$.
    By definition, there exists some $\hpa\in\hptm{A}$ such that $\hpx\dual[\hpP]\hpa$.
    The duality $\hpx\dual[\hpP]\hpa$ corresponds to some undirected path $p_{\hpx\hpa} = (\hpx,\dots,\hpa)$ in $\dependency(\hpP)$, which must contain at least one edge that connects some *bound* name $\hpy$ to some *free* name $\hpb$, say, $\edge\hpy\hpb$.
    By definition, any edge in $\dependency(\hpP)$ generated by a cut connects two *bound* names. Therefore, $\edge\hpy\hpb$ must be generated by a link.
    By @lemma:hcp-blocking-implies-ready, $\hpP=\hpEE[\hpLink\hpy\hpb]$.
    Hence, $\hpP\hpEvalA$.
