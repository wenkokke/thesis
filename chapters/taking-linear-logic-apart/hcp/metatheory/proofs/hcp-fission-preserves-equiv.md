Proof.
  ~ The cases for reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity, and congruence follow from the same properties of the structural congruence of HCP.
    The cases for the axioms are as follows:

    - Case \Rule{C-SC-LinkComm}.

      Immediately, by \Rule{H-SC-LinkComm}.

    - Case \Rule{C-SC-CutComm}.

      Immediately, by \Rule{H-SC-NewComm} and \Rule{H-SC-ParComm}.

    - Case \Rule{C-SC-CutAssoc}.

      Immediately, by \Rule{H-SC-ScopeExt}, \Rule{H-SC-NewAssoc}, and \Rule{H-SC-ParAssoc}.
