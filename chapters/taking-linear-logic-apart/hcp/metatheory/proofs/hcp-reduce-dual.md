Proof.
  ~ By inversion on the derivation of $\hpNew(\hpx\hpx')(\hpP\hpPar\hpQ)\hpSeq\hpHG$.

    There are two cases, where either $\hpP$ or $\hpQ$ is a link, which correspond to \Rule{H-E-Link} and its symmetric variant under \Rule{H-E-Equiv} with \Rule{H-SC-ParComm}.

    There are eight cases that correspond exactly to \Rule{H-E-Send}, \Rule{H-E-Close}, \Rule{H-E-Select1}, \Rule{H-E-Select2}, and their symmetric variants under \Rule{H-E-Equiv} with \Rule{H-SC-ParComm}.
