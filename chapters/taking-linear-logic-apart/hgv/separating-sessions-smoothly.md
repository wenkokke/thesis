# Separating Sessions Smoothly {#separating-sessions-smoothly}

This section contains the paper with the same title, written in collaboration with Simon Fowler, Ornela Dardha, Sam Lindley, and J. Garrett Morris, which was originally published in the journal Logical Methods in Computer Science, Volume 19, Issue 3, 2023, and is an extended journal version of the paper with the same title and authors originally published in the proceedings for the 32nd International Conference on Concurrency Theory (CONCUR 2021) as part of the Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs) series.

J. Garrett Morris acted as my second Ph.D. supervisor from 2016 to 2017, and Sam Lindley acted as my second Ph.D. supervisor from 2018 to 2024.

The work presented in the paper was conceived of by all the authors.
I co-developed Hypersequent GV and was primarily responsible for the correspondence between Hypersequent GV and Hypersequent CP.
