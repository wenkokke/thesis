# Discussion {#hgv-discussion}

This section proceeds as follows:

- In @cooking-gv-with-cut,
  I present an alternative formulation of GV that uses cuts, rather than lock typing, and argue this significantly simplifies the metatheory of GV.
- In @lock-types-cuts-and-hypersequents,
  I discuss the relation between GV with cuts, lock typing, and hypersequents.
