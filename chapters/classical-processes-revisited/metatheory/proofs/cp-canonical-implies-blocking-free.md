Proof.
  ~ By @proposition:cp-beta-free-iff-blocked-on-free, there exists a set $\cptm{A}\subseteq\fn(\cpP)$ such that $\blocked(\cpP,\cptm{A})$.
    By definition, $\cptm{A}\subseteq\blocking(\cpP)$.
    It remains to show that $\blocking(\cpP)\subseteq\cptm{A}$.

    By contradiction. Assume $\cpx\in\blocking(\cpP)$ and $\cpx\notin\cptm{A}$.

    By definition, there exists some $\cpa\in\cptm{A}$ such that $\cpx\dual[\cpP]\cpa$.
    The duality $\cpx\dual[\cpP]\cpa$ corresponds to some undirected path $p_{\cpx\cpa} = (\cpx,\dots,\cpa)$ in $\dependency(\cpP)$, which must contain at least one edge that connects some *bound* name $\cpy$ to some *free* name $\cpb$, say, $\edge\cpy\cpb$.
    <!-- (In fact, due to @lemma:cp-link-bound, it contains exactly one such edge, and $\cpb=\cpa$.) -->
    By definition, any edge in $\dependency(\cpP)$ generated by a cut connects two *bound* names. Therefore, $\edge\cpy\cpb$ must be generated by a link.
    By @lemma:cp-blocking-implies-ready, $\cpP=\cpEE[\cpLink\cpy\cpb]$.
    Hence, $\cpP\cpEvalA$.
