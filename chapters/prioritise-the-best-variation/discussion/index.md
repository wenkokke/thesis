# Discussion {#priorities-discussion}

This section proceeds as follows:

- In @pcp-relation-to-cp,
  we discuss the relation between PCP and CP.
- In @pcp-priority-inference,
  we define sound and complete priority inference for PCP.

In this section, PCP's processes and PGV's terms are printed in $\tmprimaryname$, both of their types are printed in $\typrimaryname$, and both of their priorities are printed in $\prprimaryname$, and all are rendered in a sans-serif font.
To save on accessible colour combinations, the processes and terms, types, and priorities of *any other system* are printed in $\tmsecondaryname$, $\tysecondaryname$, and $\prsecondaryname$, respectively, all are rendered in an italicised font with serif, and any relations, such as typing and reduction, are marked by a subscript.
