# Prioritise the Best Variation {#prioritise-the-best-variation}

This section contains the paper with the same title, written in collaboration with Ornela Dardha, which was originally published in the journal Logical Methods in Computer Science, Volume 19, Issue 4, 2023, which is an extended journal version of the paper with the same title and authors originally published in the proceedings for the 41st International Conference on Formal Techniques for Distributed Objects, Components, and Systems (FORTE 2021) as part of the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.

The work presented in the paper was conceived of by all the authors.
I co-developed Priority GV and was primarily responsible for the initial draft of its theory and metatheory.
I adapted the changes to the reduction semantics of Priority CP from my previous work on CP.
