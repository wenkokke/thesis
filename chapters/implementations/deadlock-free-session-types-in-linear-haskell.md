# Deadlock-Free Session Types in Linear Haskell {#deadlock-free-session-types-in-linear-haskell}

This section contains the paper with the same title, in collaboration with Ornela Dardha, which was originally published in the proceedings of the ACM SIGPLAN International Symposium on Haskell (Haskell 2021).

The work presented in the paper was conceived of by all the authors.
I implemented the Haskell library, developed the refined version of Priority GV's type system and its monadic reflection, wrote the initial draft of the paper, and co-authored the comparison with existing Haskell libraries for session-typed channels.
